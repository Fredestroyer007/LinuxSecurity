# LinuxSecurity
Out of laziness for the next time I need to setup a Linux distro on my laptop, here is a small script to setup and harden Elementary OS 5.1 Hera. But it should work fine on any Ubuntu derivative...


## TODO
- Add MAC adress randomization
- Force 1.1.1.1 on all new Wifi connections
- Add ipv6 to ufw
- Add linpeas security checkup?
- Automatic setup for Github SSH keys?
- 2 factor authenfication for login?
- Making password hash more difficult
